    <h1>Assessment on Dietary Intake</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Number of Meals Per Day</h2>
      <p class="description">Among 35 respondents, 13 males and 11 females consumed three meals per day. A smaller portion consumed two meals (3 males and 7 females), and only 1 male had a single meal per day.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Food Frequency Patterns</h2>
      <p class="description">All respondents were vegetarians. Daily consumption of rice was universal. Ragi, wheat, pulses like toor dal, cowpea, and vegetables formed a major part of the diet. Economic constraints influenced the limited intake of fruits, meat, and nuts.</p>
